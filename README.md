# rnartist-gallery-data

This project stores data about [RNArtistCore](https://github.com/fjossinet/RNArtistCore) scripts found with the bot [RNArtist Gallery](https://twitter.com/RnartistGallery). [RNArtistCore](https://github.com/fjossinet/RNArtistCore) scripts describe plotting instructions to produce nice drawings of RNA secondary structures.

The graphical tool [RNArtist](https://github.com/fjossinet/RNArtist) downloads the data of this project to easily load and execute a script. The RNA secondary structure produced can be modified to fit your needs. You can publish your own scripts from RNArtist as GitHub Gist that will be found with the bot [RNArtist Gallery (https://twitter.com/RnartistGallery)
